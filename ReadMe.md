# 📚 Advanced Java Programs 🚀

Welcome to the repository containing a rich set of **Java programs** ranging from **Core Java (ArrayList, LinkedList, Strings)** to **Swing GUI**, **Servlets**, **JSP**, and **JDBC** operations. Each program is crafted to demonstrate specific Java functionalities and concepts, making this repo a one-stop guide for hands-on learning! 💡

## 🍏 Data Structures with ArrayList & LinkedList

### 🟢 **ArrayList Operations**
- Add elements, insert at specific positions, update, access, and remove elements.
- Search for elements and find list size.
- Iterate using loops and `Iterator`.
- Sort elements and extract sublists.
- Clear entire list.
- Special programs like:
  - Color management
  - Searching for "Red"
  - Sorting color list
  - Extracting subset
  - Removing specific entries

### 🔵 **LinkedList Operations**
- Add elements at the beginning, end, or specific position.
- Iterate from specific position or in reverse using `Iterator` or `descendingIterator()`.
- Swap elements and get element positions.
- Insert custom entries and manipulate the list dynamically.

## ✨ String Handling & Manipulations

### 🔠 **Basic String Operations**
- Create strings, access characters, check length, and modify contents.
- Compare strings and perform search operations.
- Extract substrings, remove whitespaces, and concatenate.
- Validate emails with `contains()`, `startsWith()`, and `endsWith()`.
- Use `StringBuilder` for efficient modifications and formatting.
- Performance comparison between `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder`.

### 🧩 **String Exercise Programs**
- Check if string is null or empty.
- Count number of occurrences of a substring.
- Reverse a string and check for palindrome.
- Remove whitespaces and capitalize each word.
- Check if a string contains only digits.
- Truncate long strings and count total number of words.
- Generate random strings of specified length.

## 🖥️ Java Swing GUI Applications

- Display welcome message in **blue** with custom font styles.
- Use buttons to:
  - Show country names or images.
  - Perform actions based on user clicks.
- Use `JList` to display country list and show corresponding capital.
- Create TabbedPane with color themes on switch.

## 🌐 Java Servlets (Dynamic Web Programming)

- Calculate **factorial** of a number via Servlet + HTML form.
- Use **Cookies** to count number of visits and set expiry time.
- Determine if a number is **prime** using form input.
- Store and retrieve form data using Cookies or Sessions.

---

## 📝 JSP Programs for Dynamic Web Interactions

- Create and manage user **sessions** and **cookies** dynamically.
- Use JDBC with MySQL to:
  - Insert, update, delete, and retrieve records.
  - Handle operations on `coffee` table (id, name, price).
  - Manage `employee` table and generate salary reports.
- Calculate and display **grand salary** with formatted output.
